# Final Research Project Description

**Class benchmark** project [description](2021MLbenchmark.md)

**Project Manager: Bishal** 
Contact Bishal for any coding or data processing, python notebook related issues.
* Project Presentation [Template](Presentation-Template.md)
* Project Report [Template](Report-Template.md)
* Project Python Notebook [Setup](SETUP.md)
* Exploratory Data Analysis [Template](EDA-Template.ipynb)

**CS4347** 30pt total. In this project, you need to pick a real data set for which you believe there are interesting questions to answer. You will then apply different machine learning approaches that we have covered in this course to find the best way to answer these questions. The project will be completed in groups up to 4 for CS4347.

**CS5369L** 40pt total. In this project, you will tackle a real benchmark (Kaggle) or instructor specified challenge. Instructor will provide a list of projects to cghoose from.  If you have a project in mind, contact instructor early for approval.  All project proposal ideas need to be approved before Oct 21 deadline.  You will then apply different machine learning approaches that we have covered in this course to find the best way to answer these questions, and compare your findings to state-of-art that is available. The project will be completed in groups up to 3.

**Suggestions**

  * I highly recommend starting to work on your project Python code as soon as you get my approval on your dataset. If your proposal is ready before the deadline, please feel free to send it to me for approval.
  * Since you will be applying the methods we learned in this class on your datasets, your assignments and practice Python code should be very helpful!
  * Please don't wait until the last week, or you won't have time to finis (Nov 18th midterm checkpoint) 

# Project Proposal 5pt (all)
due Oct 26th EOD 
* Approach (email or teams) instructor by Oct 21st EOD
  * Incorporate feedback for the proposal submission
* Copy [Report-Template.md](Report-Template.md) to Project-Proposal.md(.ipynb)
* Add content to .md 
  * Add what you have known and researched up to the submission point
  * You are not expected to add all details
  * You are expected to start addressing and thinking about the questions asked 
* Check-in to your class repo by deadline

# Midterm Checkpoint Nov 18 EOD 5pt(CS4347)/10pt(CS5369L)
* Copy Project-Proposal.md(.ipynb) to Project-Midterm.md(.ipynb) after Oct 26th
  * edit Project-Midterm.md using markdown based on instructors feedback 
* Add all new changes to Project-Midterm.md until Nov 18 EOD
  * keep adding the findings and documentation until the Midterm deadline 
* Separate the new code documentation and installation instructions into README.md 
  * All new code documentation and installation instructions should be added to project repository README.md file
  
# Final project presentation 5pt(CS4347)/10pt(CS5369L)
* Project Presentation [Template](Presentation-Template.md)
* Check in presentation slides (pdf, html, pptx) to project repo before scheduled to present 

|  When   |    Team   |  Points | Mode | Grading | 
| ------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------|-------|
| Nov 30th    | CS5369L teams (up to 3 members)  | 10  | Entire team in person in class | CS4347 students will assign 5pt based on isntructor provided rubric (participation credit for them) | 
| Dec 2nd     | CS4347 teams (up to 4 members) | 5 | Record 10 min presentation and post on MediaFlo prior to the course, random selection of top presentatition in person - participation credit if all present | Instructor|

The goal of the presentation is to give you a chance to share with your classmates the exciting problem you have been working on, how you solved it and the interesting findings you discovered. Prepare a **10-minute** presentation, which will be followed by 5-3 minutes of questions from your instructor, the TA, and your classmates.

**Tips:** In preparing the presentation you should be aiming it at a smart audience with statistical training to the level of multiple linear regression but not beyond. You should not just say _We did KNN&quot_ but also explain the basic idea of how it works, why it might be better than linear regression etc. Among other things, points will be allocated for clear articulations of the question of interest, the approach you used to solve it, the reason you chose that approach, and the conclusions you were able to draw. Try to make your presentation slides interesting by including more visuals (figures, charts, tables) and less text.
 *Creating good presentations [tips](http://guides.lib.umich.edu/content.php?pid=345460&amp;sid=2831071)

Slides for the presentations
1. Description of the data and the question/s that you are interested in answering.
2. Review of some of the approaches that you tried or thought about trying.
3. Summary of the final approach you used and why you chose that approach.
4. Summary of the results.
5. Conclusions.
  
# Project Final Report and Documentation, and code due Dec 7th EOD  15pt(all)
* Project-Midterm.md(.ipynb) TO Project-Final.md(.ipynb) after Nov 23
  * edit based on instructors feedback 
* All new code documentation and installation instructions should be added to project repository README.md file  
* You need to submit all code and report to your class repo under ```project``` folder
* Grading of the final project:
  * Machine Learning goals met 5pt 
  * Quality of the work 5 pt 
  * Feedback implemented 5 pt 
 
# Teaming Quiz due Dec 7th EOD 

Part of participation grade - the feedback will contribute to penalty score to be taken from final research project points max 
* Anonymous feedback on how much the teammates have contributed
* Did you end up submitting bigger piece to your own repo and did not share it with others because nobody contributed and you had to do somone else's part to complete the project in time? 
* What did you learn from team project after-COVID time? 
* Were you meeting in person on campus or not? Why?
